## Description
**ClientAccountManager** is a banking system for managing clients and bank accounts. This project is part of the Bootcamp Tech Girls Power by NTT DATA, designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, use of Java and SQL, and the implementation of basic business rules.

The system will allow clients to perform the following operations:
- Register clients.
- Open bank accounts.
- Make deposits and withdrawals.
- Check account balances.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 8 / Java 11**: Programming language for system development.
- **SQL (MySQL)**: For data persistence of clients and bank accounts.
